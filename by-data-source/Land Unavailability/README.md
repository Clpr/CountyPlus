# README - Lutz & Sand (2023) Land Unavailability Index

The land unavailability used in _CountyPlus_ comes from the Land Unavailability Index by Lutz & Sand (2023). It is a public-available alternative to the land supply instrument by Saiz (2010). The Lutz & Sand (2023) index uses high-resolution GIS data to measure the land availability for the housing construction industry.
