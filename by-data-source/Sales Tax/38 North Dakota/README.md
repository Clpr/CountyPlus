1. Data source: [North Dakota Tax Data (nd.gov)](https://www.tax.nd.gov/data)

2. North Dakota DoR reports "taxable sales & purchase" in quarterly reports. Until 2016Q4, these numbers are provided in pdf files under "Sales and Use Tax Statistical Report Archives" with name e.g. "2014 4th Qtr ND Sales & Use Tax Statistical Report"; Since 2017Q1, the data are provided as PowerBI tables under "North Dakota Sales and Use Tax Statistical Report (Interactive Power BI report)"

3. We define fiscal year as Q3 of last year to Q2 this year, e.g. FY 2006 consists of 2005Q3, 2005Q4, 2006Q1, 2006Q2. We manually aggregate quartly data.

4. In statistical reports, we use "Taxable Sales and Purchases" number.

> **IMPORTANT**: by 09/28/2024, the North Dakota DoR has refactored their website such that all data in form of PDF quarterly reports before 2017 are no longer accessible. Data since 2017 are available as PowerBI figures and a linked Excel file.
>
> We are still working on re-locating the PDF files before that.
