1. Data source: 

2. Vermont reports sales and use tax as tax base (taxable sales) rather than tax revenue. "The receipts numbers included in the report are sales dollars, NOT the tax revenue (tax dollars). You can calculate tax revenue by multiplying the taxable receipts by the appropriate tax rate."

3. No need to adjust by tax rate

4. On "https://tax.vermont.gov/data-and-statistics/", we download "Fiscal Year" under "Monthly Update" for each year. These files are provided in pdf until 2014. Since 2015, xlsx files are available

5. Essex & Orleans county are reported as a whole until 2014. Same as Franklin and Grand Isle county.  We compute the average share of e.g. Essex after 2014 and apply such a share onto the shared series until 2014.
