* Data source: [Taxable Sales Data By Locality | Cooper Center](https://www.coopercenter.org/taxable-sales)
  * <u>Legacy</u>: We kept (without using is) legacy estimates (by ourselves) based on sales tax revenue by DoR in folder `archive`: [Local Estimates | Virginia Tax](https://www.tax.virginia.gov/local-estimates)
* The Cooper center for economic and policy studies estimates taxable sales across counties since 1996. We collect their estimates as our estimates on county consumption expenditure
  * <u>Until 2017</u>: use "Annual Time Series: DOWNLOAD ANNUAL TAXABLE SALES, 1984-2017" as one excel file. The file name is `tsannualseries1984-2017.xls`
  * <u>Since 2018</u>: Data files are provided in excel files. Use "annual" estimates
    * <u>2018 and 2019</u>: `tsa18.xlsx` and `TSA19.xlsx`
    * <u>After that</u>: `AnnualTaxableSalesReport_yyyy.xlsx` (for future use only)
  * Data are copied to `data.xlsx` and processed there with tech notes
